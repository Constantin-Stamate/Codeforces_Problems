# Codeforces Problems – Algorithm Practice Archive

This Java project is a structured collection of **algorithmic problem solutions** inspired by challenges from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). It is designed to improve competitive programming skills, focusing on **clean code**, **problem-solving patterns**, and general **algorithmic thinking** using Java.

---

## Project Context

This repository was developed as part of continuous practice for mastering algorithms and data structures, commonly used in contests and technical interviews. It includes both **introductory problems** and more **advanced challenges**.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── codeforces_1/     # First set of Codeforces problems
├── codeforces_2/     # Second set of Codeforces problems
├── codeforces_3/     # Third set of Codeforces problems
```

Each `.java` file inside these folders contains:
- A commented title with the original Codeforces problem link
- A complete Java solution
- Optionally, explanations or comments inline

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Java (JDK 8 or later)**  
   Download from: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)


2. **Clone the repository**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Constantin-Stamate/Codeforces_Problems.git
```

3. **Navigate to the project folder**

```bash
  cd Codeforces_Problems
```

4. **Go to a problem folder and compile a file (example)**

```bash
  cd src/codeforces_1
```

5. **Compile a solution file from a problem folder**

```bash
  javac Array.java
```

6. **Run a compiled solution file from a problem folder**

```bash
  java Array
```

✅ You can also open the project in an IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **VS Code** for easier development and testing.
